KTU Semester 3 Java Lab Cycle 2

Program Contents :-
1. Write a Java class having overloaded methods to calculate area of rectangle
   and circle.
2. Define a class Queue for representing a queue data structure. The class must
   define a default constructor, a parameterized constructor and functions for enqueue, de-queue and display operations. Write a Java program to implement
   this.
3. Write a program to print the area and perimeter of a triangle having sides of 3, 4 and 5 units by creating
   a class named 'Triangle' without any parameter in its constructor.
4. Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating a class named 'Area' taking the values of its
   length and breadth as parameters of its constructor and having a method named 'returnArea' which returns
   the area of the rectangle. Length and breadth of rectangle are entered through keyboard.
5. Create a class with a method that prints "This is parent class" and its subclass with another method that
   prints "This is child class". Now, create an object for each of the class and call
            1 - method of parent class by object of parent class
            2 - method of child class by object of child class
            3 - method of parent class by object of child class
